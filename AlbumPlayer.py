#TODO:
# Remove Add Album from web
# Remove non-user relevant config items from web (spotify id/secret)
# Expirement with balega os wifi connect, can this also prompt for a sonos speaker name I can connect to?
# Build a docker image for the config/dependencies/python/wifi connect - ideal state I think?
# Add tracks to the db? Could be good for tracking purposes - which tracks are getting skipped, when albums are removed from player, track play counting
#
#Structure:
#   -NFCPoller.py - Handles NFC polling and tag detection
#   -SonosController.py - Handles Sonos API interactions
#   -SpotifyController.py - Handles Spotify API interactions
#   -AlbumPlayer.py - Main script that integrates everything
#   -DBConnector.py - Handles database connections and queries
#   -config.py - Configuration file for API keys and settings
